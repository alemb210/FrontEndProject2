      <p class="rowTextHeader"> What is Mental Health? </p>
      <p class="rowTextSubHeader"> Mental health refers to the human condition on a non-physical level. This means our
        emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing. It is often an overlooked aspect of a person's health due to the
        non-immediate danger. However, our mental health affects many aspects of our lives, such as our decision-making,
        general mood,
        relationships with people, and reaction to stressors. </p>

      <p class="rowTextHeader"> How does this affect Tech students? </p>
      <p class="rowTextSubHeader"> Tech students are often under heavy stress for multiple reasons. Tech, as a
        specialized high school, is particularly rigorous in it's education. The
        culture places a heavy emphasis on grades and scores, amping up stress and deteriorating
        the self-worth of many students who do not perform to their liking. Additionally, the high-school ages can also
        place a significant amount of stress on students. Teenagers often feel pressure to conform with their peers, and
        thus can often become stressed over other people's perception of them. </p>
