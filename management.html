                    Time Management
                </div>
                <p> Managing your time can be difficult but is essential to managing stress. Try to cut out "blank"
                    portions of your day, and instead plan what you will do beforehand, even relaxation time. Also, do
                    your best do rid your surroundings of distractions when studying or working. Instead of studying
                    next to your phone, plan breaks ahead of time. One method that practices this is the "pomodoro"
                    method, where study sessions are consistently broken by short breaks. Managing your time will make
                    you feel more free, efficient, and relaxed.</p>

                    Breaking Down Tasks
                </div>
                <p> Often in our lives we are stumped by tasks that seem too difficult to approach head-on. This leads
                    to discouragement and sometimes accomplishing nothing. An effective method of dealing with this is
                    to break down tasks. Figure out what you need to do to accomplish a task, breaking it into segments
                    you feel you can tackle. Then, create an order for these tasks. This can be as simple as creating an
                    order for your homework from courses to approach a large workload. This will allow you to work
                    efficiently and with purpose! </p>

                    Exercise
                </div>
                <p> Mental health is actually connected to our physical body in many ways. If we are in poor physical
                    condition, our mental health will deteroriate alongside it. Sedentary lifestyles are often met with
                    with poor mental health due to the lack of blood flow to the brain. This is easily fixed with
                    semi-regular exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise! Although routine and planned exercise is
                    beneficial, simply performing jumping jacks or jogging can boost one's mental health. </p>
